# 🎯 Feature and Target Definition

## Target Variable

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
| Target Column | `target` |
| Problem Type | Classification |
| Business Meaning | Predicts the final outcome based on input features |

---

# 🔢 Numerical Features

| Feature | Reason |
|---|---|
| feature1 | Represents measurable numeric values |
| feature2 | Continuous numeric quantity |

## Scaling Strategy

Numerical features may be scaled using `StandardScaler` during preprocessing.

---

# 🏷️ Categorical Features

| Feature | Type | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| category1 | Nominal | Represents category labels without order |

## Encoding Strategy

Categorical features may use:
- One-Hot Encoding
- Ordinal Encoding (if ordered categories exist)

---

# ❌ Excluded Columns

| Column | Reason Excluded |
|---|---|
| id | Unique identifier with no predictive value |
| timestamp | Not available during real-world prediction |

---

# ⚠️ Edge Case Handling

## Binary Features

Binary columns stored as `0/1` are treated conceptually based on meaning, not storage type.

## Ordinal Features

Ordinal features are handled separately if category ordering matters.

## High Cardinality Features

High-cardinality categorical columns may require grouping or advanced encoding.

## Timestamp Features

Timestamp columns are excluded unless converted into meaningful features.

---

# 📊 Feature Distribution Analysis

EDA is performed before modeling to understand feature behavior.

## Numerical Inspection

- Summary statistics
- Histograms
- Boxplots
- Skewness analysis

## Categorical Inspection

- Value counts
- Rare category detection
- Imbalance analysis

## Key Goals

- Detect skewness
- Detect outliers
- Detect imbalance
- Identify preprocessing requirements

---

# ⚖️ Data Splitting Strategy

## Split Configuration

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Training Data | 80% |
| Testing Data | 20% |
| Random State | 42 |
| Stratification | Enabled |

---

## Why This Strategy?

- Training data is used for learning
- Testing data simulates unseen real-world data
- Stratification preserves class balance

---

# 🔒 Leakage Prevention

The following precautions are implemented:

- Target column excluded from features
- ID columns excluded
- No preprocessing before splitting
- No scaling before splitting
- No encoding before splitting
- Test data remains untouched

---

# 🚨 Data Leakage Demonstration

This project also demonstrates train-test contamination leakage.

## Incorrect Workflow

```python
scaler.fit_transform(X)
train_test_split(X_scaled, y)
```

This leaks test-set information into training.

---

## Correct Workflow

```python
train_test_split(X, y)

scaler.fit(X_train)
scaler.transform(X_test)
```

This preserves honest evaluation.

---

# ⚙️ ML Workflow
